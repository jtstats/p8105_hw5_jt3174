# Problem 1

``` r

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

``` r
# write a function that fill all missing numeric variables with the mean of non-missing values and all missing categorical variables with virginica

filling = function(column) {
  # make sure the argument is a vector, and if not, stop
  if (!is.vector(column)) {
    stop("Argument should be a vector.")
  }
  # to distinguish numeric variable 
  if (is.numeric(column)) {
    # to make sure we have all orginal data in the output
    column = column %>% 
    # to replace all missing data with the mean of what are not missing in the vector argument

  }

  else if (is.character(column)) {

Comment: According to the plot above, we can see that the starting week
observation between two groups are roughly the same, but as the time
proceeded, we can see that the experimental groupâ€™s weekly observation
started to go up while the control group are roughly staying at the same
places where they started.
